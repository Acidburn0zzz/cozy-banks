Code organisation
=================

### Components

If components have an associated style, group the style with the component into
a folder. Ex: `BackButton`

### Ducks

* Ducks groups actions/reducers/views for a particular high-level function

* Sometimes you can have a duck without views, typically when it concerns
a particular doctype.
