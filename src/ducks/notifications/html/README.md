How to develop on templates
==============

With the `TEST_TEMPLATES` environment variable, a special CLI will be built
that allows to test the templates with custom data.

```
$ env TEST_TEMPLATES=true yarn watch:services
# Will continuously build `build/testTemplates.js`
$ node build/testTemplates.js -t balanceLower -d src/ducks/notifications/html/data/accounts.json
index.html written !
```

You can open the generated HTML file in your browser or use the Preview feature
in Mailchimp to check that everything is correctly rendered on the various email clients.

### Under the covers

The templates are [Handlebars](handlebarsjs.com) templates using the
[mjml](https://mjml.io/documentation) language. `mjml` greatly reduces the pains to develop an
email template as it deals with a lot of quirks for you. It features ready-made
components to make responsive email templates. Behind the scene, it uses `React`
to implement custom components, and [juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice)
to inline the CSS into the HTML. The [handlebars-layouts](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts) plugin is used to provide an easy way to extend a base template (Ã  la `jinja`)

Other templates :

```
nodemon --exec "node transactions-notification.js" -e js,css,hbs,json
```

### Assets

Assets in `assets/` are uploaded to `https://downcloud.cozycloud.cc` on every deployment on CI. It can also be done manually with the `yarn uploadStaticFiles` script.
